# Path Finding Visualisation Tool
• Implemented BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two cells on a 2D grid with obstacles
• Used pygame module to create a responsive 2D grid for allowing the user to select the start and end cell, and to 
 plot obstacles
• The tool shows the traversal of the visited cells and highlights the shortest path/(any path for BFS) if it exist

1) In order to select obstacles, move mouse pointer to corresponding cell and left click the mouse.
2) In order to select target cell, move pointer to the cell and right click the mouse
3) after that press any key and shortest path will be printed in blue color
4) green cells are the that are added to queue
5) red cells are the cell which are visited during the traversal
