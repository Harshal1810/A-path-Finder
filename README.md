# Path Finding Visualisation Tool
• Implemented BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two cells on a 2D grid with obstacles
• Used pygame module to create a responsive 2D grid for allowing the user to select the start and end cell, and to 
 plot obstacles
• The tool shows the traversal of the visited cells and highlights the shortest path/(any path for BFS) if it exists
